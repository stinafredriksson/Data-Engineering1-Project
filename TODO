Set up right now:

On master launch new worker
cd ~
sudo nano /etc/hosts
workerX worker_ip

scp -i .ssh/DE_12.pem .ssh/DE_12.pem ubuntu@new_ip:/home/ubuntu
scp -i .ssh/DE_12.pem set_up_worker.sh ubuntu@new_ip:/home/ubuntu
ssh -i .ssh/DE_12.pem ubuntu@new_ip

bash set_up_worker.sh

The set_up_worker.sh downloads java, hadoop and spark. sets the environment variable.
Appends drivers and master to etc/hosts.
Fetech config files from master.

OBS: The worker hostname is put manually. Also the worker needs reboot to set the worker hostname.
